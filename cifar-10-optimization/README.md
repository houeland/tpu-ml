## Experimenting with different CIFAR-10 optimizer settings

I have been experimenting with thousands of different runs of CIFAR-10 and different optimizer settings to be able to characterize the behavior and hopefully say something that could generalize more widely.

I haven't completed analyzing it or written up the results yet, so for now there's just a couple of graphs where I was comparing some of the results.

Learning rate is on the x-axis, and test-set accuracy after 100 training epochs on the y-axis.

Note: I have around 20GB of results from 10k+ training runs. If anyone's at all interesting in this data or helping to analyze it, please contact me!
