## Experimenting with different CIFAR-10 optimizer settings

I have been experimenting with thousands of different runs of CIFAR-10 and different optimizer settings to be able to characterize the behavior and hopefully say something that could generalize more widely.

Note: I have around 20GB of underlying data from 75k+ training runs. If anyone's at all interesting in this data or helping to analyze it, please contact me!
